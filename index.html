                    <q>We had the opportunity to meet your Solaqua installation team today. They are an amazing group
                        who have worked their hearts out to get the job done safely, properly and efficiently. Their
                        professionalism, knowledge of the products, respectful, friendly customer service is second to
                        none! The solar panels looked discrete too.

                    <q>It took just under two months from the initial proposal to get my grant application submitted,
                        equipment in place, and Energy net meter installed. The
                        Solaqua crew, including the install guys were very professional and courteous. Marie from the
                        sales team was great and worked
                        with me to come up with an affordable system. I highly recommend Solaqua if you are going

                        we went with Solaqua. we were very pleased with the whole process, they handled
                        everything smoothly. All Solaqua employees were very friendly. I'm very happy with my decision
